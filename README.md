# Calamari Blog
A light-weight blogging client written in Blazor and ASP.NET Core that reads from a headless CMS system called Squidex.

- Focuses on Seperation of Concerns (SOC) and scalability
- Uses the HTML template [Clean Blog](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog) by [startbootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com/)
- Serilog is used for logging events to [any location](https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Provided-Sinks) 
- Responses are gzipped and cached

API Caching
-------

The client will cache Squidex API calls via an ICacheProvider. Cached items are cleared via a Webhook configured in Squidex.
